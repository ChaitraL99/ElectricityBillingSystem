# ElectricityBillingSystem

Create a simple electricity billing management system that will calculate the
units consumed within specified time duration and accordingly calculates the amount of money to
be paid for those units.

There will be two main modules:

• Admin
- Can log in to the system (admin credentials you can hard cord in DB).
- Can add new customers (connection).
- Can add new meters.
- Can assign meter to customers.
- Can add price per unit state wise.

• Customer
- Can log in to the system by credentials provided by the admin.
- Can provide energy consumption data for a specific time duration.
- Customers will be able to see the generated bill after entering energy data.

All the above steps have been implemented in this project.
